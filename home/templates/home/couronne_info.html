                        The Couronne league acts as <b> "King of the Hill". </b>
                        When registering, you start with a <b> rating </b> of 100 (or 100 rating points (RP) as some say and are the same thing!).
                        The top 5 in the league will assigned a symbol (First place = ü•á, Second place = ü•à, Third place = ü•â, Fourth place = üí•, Fifth place = üí´) when the league is added together (2021-12-13 <i> lucia </i>).
                        After that, more symbols are awarded at other events (eg Swedish Open = ‚≠ê and Masquerade Open = ‚ö°).<br><strong> The seasons count from Lucia to Lucia!</strong><br>
                    <h5 >Points/Rating </h5>
                    <p class="text-success"><strong>wins:</strong> You earn 1% of the opponent's rating, at the same time the opponent loses the corresponding rating.
                        Ex: If the opponent has a rating of 120, you earn 1.2 rating points from him or her .
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-danger"><strong>Loss:</strong>  You lose 1% of your own rating while the opponent earns the corresponding rating.

                    Ex: If you have 80 in rating, you lose 0.8 rating points to the opponent.  
                    <p>    <font color="grey">Average: Won or lost rating divided by the number of matches starting after two matches played.

                            Couronne is for us a "cafe game", where everyone is welcome and feels equally treated.
                            A game where everyone plays against everyone and on the same terms quite simply.
                            In tuning games, of course, a handicap system can be used to increase the interest in participating.

                        Sat before Christmas 2018 and typed couronne.se on google because I was thinking of buying a couronne game ...
                        Thought I spelled it wrong when google replied that the page did not exist? Tried twice more before I understood. No one owns the domain name
                        couronne.se.
                        I who love couronne, am a craftsman (blacksmith) and carry the epithet computer nerd, of course signed up the domain immediately.
                        And that's the way it is.

# Introduction

- This small website was designed mainly for people who like and reads books. People who want to find inspiration for new books.


- The focus of the website is to create an easy way to reach people who want to find new books. To make the site more attractive, we add a rating comment section.


- The simplicity and small scale of the website is an important aspect to achieve an interest in bookmarking the return page.

- If you like simple book review sites, you have gone to enjoy this one.


- This is the third of four Milestone projects that the developer must complete during his Full-Stack web development program at The Code Institute.

- The most important requirements were to build a MongoDB-backed Flask project for a web application that allows users to store and manipulate data records (CRUD). [**HTML5**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5),  [**CSS3**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), [**JavaScript**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/javascript), [**Flask**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/).

### Scope

- The site is for people who like books and want to find new books to read.

- Users who find this website are most certainly one who is looking for just and precisely for a book review and recommendation site.

#### A scope was defined into two categories:

- ##### Content Requirements

  - The user will be looking for:
    - Information about the books and the see the rate of them.
    - A quick way to find high rated books.

- ##### Functionality Requirements
  - The user will be able to:
    - Easily navigate through the site to find the information they want.

## Design

### Color Scheme

The main colors used throughout the website are teal and white.



The chosen color scheme is chosen to get a clear and nice view to integrate with.

- I find the color combination on-site [COLORS](https://coolors.co/)

### Typography

Font font-family: Roboto is used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case of import failure.

- I use [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for my font used on the site

### Picture

- The images used on the page are copied link addresses found via Google.

- The images provide a static alternative text to use if the element cannot be reproduced.

# Features

### Design Features

Each page on the website has a consistent, responsive navigation system through a navigation bar on the top of the site.


### Existing Features

#### The website consists of four main pages (Home, users books, Add book, Log Out/ Log In and register) And a fifth page for Manage Categories only for Admin (Login: Username = admin, and Password = admin).

- ### Start Page (Home):
  - Navbar (fixed) on top of the Home page is the same across the whole site.
   - Home goes to the start page.
   - Users Books goes to the owner's books page for editing and deletion.
   - Add Book goes to add_book form.
   - Manage Categories (Only for admin) goes to the page where admin can add and delete categories(LogIn: Username = admin, and password = admin).
   - Log In / Log Out page for log in and log out.
   - Register for new user to register.
   
   
  - At the top of the page, we find our navbar which turns into a burger for smaller screen sizes..
    - At the top of the page is a search box.
    - In the center of the page we have the Users' posted books that are clickable for expansion for more information.
    
- ### User Owners books:
  - Here, the user can edit and delete their uploaded books.
  - In the expandable field we find two (green for edit and red for delete) icons/buttons:
    - The first button is the green edit button:
      - Are used if you want to edit your own books.
    - The second button is the delete button:
      - Are used to immediately delete the selected book .
    

- ### 404 page (404.html):
  - Not done yet due to lack of time. &#129324;

## Features to Implement in the future

- When deleting a book or category, make sure that it is verified. Instead of the book being removed immediately without verification.

- Better control of input on the pages add book/edit book and on manage category.

- Verification for book removal

- Pagination on pages that are likely to be long.

# Issues and Bugs

- Problems getting verification for book removal to work. Ended up lacking time, so I had to put that feature on future implement.
   - Have been bothering with this problem for far too long. I ordered time for the tutor sessions but was never contacted by anyone at Slack where I thought the e-meeting would take place.

- Problems with my javascript code appearing with 8 spaces when looking in GitHub. Apparently can not be changed.

  - Solution: You can append ?ts=2 or ?ts=4 to the URL to change the tab-size.

##### Other information:
```
This project has been really awkward since my computer crashed and panicked and had to fix it with an emergency solution.
It took a lot of my time and energy.
I tore off my hamstrings and have been to the hospital a number of times, which has also taken my time and energy.
